QuickCheck experiments in Java

AAA - also experimenting with FitNesse


•	What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?
I entered the sotware development profession only in my mid-forties. Before that I've been a business analyst, technical marketeer and consultant at a high-street firm. Those experiences gave me some broad views about the whole picture, but I haven't regretted one second getting out of there.

•	If you would not have been in your current industry / role, what would have become of you?
Commercial pilot. Cargo/postal planes somewhere in Canada or in the Andes. Not joking. I regret that in my youth I did't get the opportunity to really dream about my adult life and plan for it. One of my first priorities is to make sure my daughters will have that opportunity in full.

•	What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?
I am a technologist and I believe technology is the first and strongest driver of the present historical era. On one hand I believe that agile (I also like the term "lean") is the right way to do things on the workplace. On the other hand, I still have to see it give an organisation the competitive edge beyond any reasonable doubt. I am looking out to be part of a collective experience that will demonstrate just that, and will change for good the rules of the game.

•	What drives you ?
I am 99.99% innerly motivated, something that a few past managers of mine found rather frustrating. What I pursue is described in the previous answer.

•	What is your biggest achievement?
I have sought and attained a position in which external circumstances are hardly able to sway my choices against my will.

•	What is the last book you have read?
"Consider Phlebas" by Iain M. Banks. Memento mori. Well, actually it's the second last but I liked it a lot, whereas the very last one will soon be erased from my scarce stock of neurons.

•	What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?


•	Who are the next two persons you would like us to ask these questions and why? (please specify name and email)
- Davide Varvello (davide.varvello@gmail.com): my first, unforgettable agile coach.
- Mirko Bonadei (mirko.bonadei@gmail.com): one who has the right tools and the right mindset.
